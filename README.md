# girfather

 I understand. You found paradise in Github. You had a good trade, you made good repos. The contributors protected you and there were forks. So you didn't need a contributor like me. Now you come and say "Don Forkleone, give me justice." But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer a pull request. You don't even think to call me "Gitfather." You come into my IRC on the day my repo is to be released and you ask me to reject PR - for money.
